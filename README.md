# TwentyTwentyTwenty
Website that helps you take a break every 20 minutes for your eyes

This was a quick side project, didn't really focus on the UI on this one much, it was more about the idea :)

This project is deployed on Netlify: https://twentytwentytwenty.netlify.app/
## Running locally
I used pnpm, but you can use npm. Instructions should be the same.
```
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```
### Building
```
pnpm build
```
